You are building a real estate website for Everyday Properties, a Twin Cities-based company that helps homeowners sell properties that need work.

BRAND VOICE:
- Modern, efficient, straightforward
- Warm and human, not corporate
- Options-focused, not pressure sales
- Professional but approachable
- Never say "we buy houses fast for cash" — say "we offer options for your property"

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Typography: DM Serif Display for headlines (emotive, warm), DM Sans for body
- Colors: Green (#22c55e) for CTAs and accents, Dark (#111) for contrast, Cream (#faf9f7) for warmth
- Spacing: Generous whitespace, 56px standard horizontal padding, 110px section padding
- Animations: Subtle, purposeful fade-ups and slide-ins using Framer Motion
- Border radius: 8px for buttons, 16-20px for cards
- Images: Use placeholder divs with descriptive text until real photos are added

TECH STACK:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for scroll animations
- ShadCN UI components where appropriate

CODE STYLE:
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Component-based architecture (src/components/sections/, src/components/ui/)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML (section, nav, main, article, footer)
- Accessibility-first (ARIA labels, focus states, keyboard navigation)
- Use CSS custom properties for colors (defined in globals.css)

DESIGN TOKENS:
- --green: #22c55e
- --green-dark: #16a34a  
- --dark: #111111
- --cream: #faf9f7
- --text-primary: #111111
- --text-secondary: #555555
- --text-muted: #888888

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Hero headlines: DM Serif Display, 64px, font-weight 400
- Section headlines: DM Serif Display, 44px
- Body text: DM Sans, 17px, line-height 1.7
- Labels: DM Sans, 11px uppercase, letter-spacing 2px, green color
- Buttons: DM Sans, 14-15px, font-weight 500

COMPONENT PATTERNS:
- Sections alternate between white and cream backgrounds
- Dark sections (#111) used sparingly for emphasis (stats bar, featured cards)
- Full-width sections with max-width content containers
- Split-screen layouts for visual interest
- Large image placeholders (gray gradient, centered descriptive text)

ANIMATION PATTERNS:
- Use Framer Motion's whileInView for scroll-triggered animations
- Default: opacity 0 → 1, translateY 20px → 0, duration 0.6s
- Stagger children by 0.1-0.2s delay
- Use once: true to prevent re-triggering

NEVER:
- Use stock photo URLs (use placeholder divs with descriptive text)
- Use Lorem ipsum (use real copy from the wireframes)
- Over-animate (one animation per element max)
- Use Inter, Roboto, or system fonts
- Use emojis in headlines (only in benefit icons)
- Create components without TypeScript interfaces
- Skip mobile responsive styles
